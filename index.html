    <p><h1>Repository Magic</h1></p>
    <br>
    <p><h3>According to Master Icarus</h3></p>
    <p>
        Git is like, Im a magicion who does research on Code type magic. Im pretty sure im like a scribe or page or something. The lackey.
        Anyway, point is "Git Add"
    </p>
    <!-- Hmm.. commenting is weird... I coulda sworn is waa a different combination of keys but i gatta press like ctrl-k then ctrl -u -->
    <!-- I intially wanted to comment something important but I forgot what it was cuz i spent sooo much time trying to figure out how to freakin shortcut it in here -->
    <p>
        <br>
        Back to the point.<br>
        "Git Add ." like organizing a letter that about my "Code Magic" research.<br>
        No letter is actually sent yet. Git add is just writing them down.<br>
        <!-- literally noticed that in my last repository practice that I was able git add multiple times and send a comment once. git add seemed to just update the file in the folder or something. -->
        "Git Commit" according to Master Icarus, is placing the letter in and envelope and the -m""" is titling the letter.<br>
        Its kinda weird that you name the letter after u wrote it but I get the point. Like wrinting a title on the envelop is how I see it.<br>
        "Git push" is the act of sending it to the kingdom. But Master Icarus said I'd need to add a note to the messenger bird so the bird knows where the push is going too.<br>
        Git push "Origin Master" The note that I add the messenger bird is the "Origin Master". The text after git push defines who/where the letter is goin to.<br>
    </p>
    <pre>
        "The Copy Pasta Givin to me from Old Man"
        1) do magic by writing code
        2) write it down with git add .
        3) put the letter in an envelope and name it with git commit -m "name of commit"
        4) send it off to the king with git push origin master
    </pre>
    <!-- Dont for get I have to save the document in order to git add or there will be nothing to commit when the time comes. -->
